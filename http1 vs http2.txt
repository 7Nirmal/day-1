QUESTION:
Write a blog on HTTP1 VS HTTP2

Hyper text transfer protocol is a protocol to send or transfer the requested data and fetch the response from the server.
It sents request from the client side, process it, and get response from server to the client.
The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997.This first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
As usgae of INTERNET increased extensilvely, http1 was struggling met existing demands.
One of the major shortcomings of http1 is handling only request at a time. For example,a web page may contains several elements
like a header,picture,text etc. If one of the requests got blocked or delayed,it may affect the loading of the entire page.
Another is security reliablity.
On addressing all the shortcomings,In 2015 http2 was introduced.compared to the previous version http2 was very much fast,reliable
and can priortize clients deamnds. It can take multiple responses from client side at a time,and with single TCP connection
it proccess and produces response.This enables the user to access a web page effectively,even while using low-bandwidth connection.
While loading heavy web pages,it can priotrize which need to be loaded first and which needed to be loaded in next steps.
This allows the user to an interrupted web experience.
