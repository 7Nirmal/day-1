Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript
Objects, in JavaScript, is itâ€™s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
Objects may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
The data are stored in the object in "key:value" method.The value can be accessed by using the key.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. 
Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. 
The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
objectName.propertyName
Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. 
You can define a property by assigning it a value.
